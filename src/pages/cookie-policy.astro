              This Cookie Policy explains how AppVin Technologies ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at <a href="https://appvintech.com">https://appvintech.com</a> ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            
            <p>
              Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, AppVin Technologies) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
            
            <p>
              We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Types of cookies we use</h2>
            
            <h3>Essential cookies</h3>
            
            <p>
              These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Website functions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Performance and functionality cookies</h3>
            
            <p>
              These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analytics and customization cookies</h3>
            
            <p>
              These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you in order to enhance your experience.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Advertising cookies</h3>
            
            <p>
              These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Social networking cookies</h3>
            
            <p>
              These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Website through third-party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.

            <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
