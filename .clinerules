# Rules of engagements

## Startup Focus
- Ship functional MVPs
- Apply First Principles & 80/20 rule
- Modular Monolith for future scaling
- Concise docs & Mermaid charts
- use context7 mcp server for latest docs on technology involved

## Technology
### Frontend: astrojs, tailwind, zod
### Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose, Multi-stage Dockerfile  

## UI/UX
- Modular, card-based design  
- Clear visual hierarchy, responsive, mobile-first  
- Micro-interactions, micro-animations, dark/light mode  
- Skeleton loading, progressive disclosure

- Reusable components  

## Code & Architecture
- DDD, SOLID, KISS, DRY, YAGNI  
- Self-documenting code, clear naming  
- Defined module boundaries for scalability  

## Security (MVP-Ready)
- Basic auth & authorization (RBAC)  
- Secure API endpoints (rate limiting, validation)  
- Encrypt sensitive data as needed  

## Testing (Lean)
- Unit tests for critical logic only
- Skip exhaustive E2E tests unless necessary  

## CI/CD & Deployment
